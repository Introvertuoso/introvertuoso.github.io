<p style="text-align: justify;">
I'm a first-year PhD student at the <a href='https://cispa.de'>Helmholtz Center CISPA</a>, supervised by <a href='https://vreeken.eu'>Jilles Vreeken</a>, while being affiliated with the <a href='https://www.neuroexplicit.org'>Research Training Group on Neuroexplicit Models</a>. I am interested in working on explainable neurosymbolic methods, particularly, for the biomedical domain.
<br><br>
Before joining the <a href='https://eda.rg.cispa.io'>Exploratory Data Analysis</a> group, I obtained my Master's of Science in <a href='https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/studium-studies/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence-master/'>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</a> at <a href='https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html'>Saarland University</a>. I wrote my Master's thesis on differentiable subgroup discovery in time-to-event (survival) data.
<br><br>
Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology Engineering from <a href='https://www.damascusuniversity.edu.sy/index.php?lang=2'>Damascus University</a>, specializing in artificial intelligence. For my graduation project, I worked on a computer vision-powered system that detects security- and safety-related events.
